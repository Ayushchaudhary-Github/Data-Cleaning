# Data Cleaning Repository

Welcome to my Data Cleaning Repository! üßπ

In this repository, you'll find a collection of raw data files and their cleaned counterparts. Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process, and this repository showcases my commitment to ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and ready for insightful analysis.

## What's Inside:

- **Raw Data**: The initial, unprocessed datasets that I've come across in various projects and contexts.

- **Cleaned Data**: The cleaned and pre-processed versions of the raw data, with inconsistencies and errors addressed, missing values filled, and outliers handled. These datasets are ready for analysis.

## Why Data Cleaning Matters:

Data quality is the foundation of meaningful insights. Properly cleaned and structured data ensures that analyses and machine learning models produce reliable and actionable results.

## How to Use:

Feel free to explore the raw and cleaned data in this repository for reference or as a starting point for your own projects. If you find them useful, don't hesitate to give them a star ‚≠ê or fork the repository to incorporate data cleaning practices into your work.
